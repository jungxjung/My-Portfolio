I don't buy bread from grocery stores anymore. I make my own bread, especially sourdough bread. I also bake cookies, cakes, and pineapple pastries (fenglisu)! <br> <br>‚úèÔ∏è<b>Drawer</b>: I draw with pencils, simply black and white. Pencils are affordable, erasable with excellent mobility, perfect for a traveler like me. I once sold a self-portrait for 200 USD, which could possibly be the peak of my artist life."
